# Fairn-t-Hub 

SCRIPT IS BACK AFTER A LONG BLACK OUTT

This is an Open-Source Project and all the scripts are Solara Supported.
This is a W.I.P Project so dont expect it to work like magic.


Too lazy to update loadstring so just execute script from [here](https://github.com/Asyrantheyt/Fairn-t-Hub/tree/main/scripts)
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asyrantheyt/Fairn-t-Hub/refs/heads/main/Loader%20Auto.lua"))()
```
