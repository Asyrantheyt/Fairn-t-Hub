# Fairn-t-Hub 
This is an Open-Source Project and all the scripts are Solara Supported.
This is a W.I.P Project so dont expect it to work like magic.
If u want to get your changes to our github Contact me on Discord @alongyt.

Too lazy to update loadstring so just execute script from [here](https://github.com/Asyrantheyt/Fairn-t-Hub/tree/main/scripts)
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asyrantheyt/Fairn-t-Hub/refs/heads/main/Loader%20Auto.lua"))()
```
